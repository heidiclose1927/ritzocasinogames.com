                            <p>Welcome to RitzocasinoGames.com. We are committed to creating a safe and enjoyable gaming environment for all our players. Responsible gambling is a core principle of our operations, and we believe that gambling should be a fun and entertaining activity, not a source of problems.

                            <h2 class="mt-5">1. Our Commitment to Responsible Gambling</h2>

                            <p>Underage gambling is illegal and irresponsible. RitzocasinoGames.com takes stringent measures to prevent minors from accessing our platform:</p>
                            <ul>
                                <li><strong>Age Verification:</strong> We implement robust age verification procedures during the registration process. All users are required to confirm they are of legal gambling age in their jurisdiction.</li>
                                <li><strong>Parental Controls:</strong> We encourage parents and guardians to utilize parental control software to prevent minors from accessing gambling websites. Several such software options are available online.</li>
                                <li><strong>Awareness:</strong> We strive to raise awareness among our players about the importance of keeping their account details secure and logging out after each session to prevent unauthorized use by minors.</li>
                            </ul>

                            <h2 class="mt-5">3. Preventing Compulsive Gambling and Providing Support</h2>
                            <p>While gambling can be entertaining, for some individuals, it can become a problem. We offer various tools and resources to promote responsible play:</p>
                            <ul>
                                <li><strong>Self-Exclusion:</strong> Players can choose to temporarily or permanently exclude themselves from playing on RitzocasinoGames.com.

                                <li><strong>Session Limits:</strong> Players can set limits on the duration of their gaming sessions. A notification will appear when your session limit is reached, prompting you to log out or take a break.</li>

                                <li><strong>Financial Awareness:</strong> We encourage players to gamble only with money they can afford to lose and never to gamble with funds intended for essential living expenses.</li>
                            </ul>

                            <h2 class="mt-5">4. Recognizing Problem Gambling</h2>
                            <p>It's important to recognize the signs of problem gambling, both in yourself and in others. Some common indicators include:</p>
                            <ul>
